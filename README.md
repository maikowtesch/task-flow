# Task Flow

## Introduction
Task Flow is a system for task management. In Task Flow the task is the main focus in the workflow, and a collaborative approach is taken in order to address it successfully.

Many times, when a problem arises, its ownership is questioned by members of different teams. Very often much energy is spent on that discussion instead of cooperating with the resolution.

In Task Flow, the task is the center of everything, and many people can cooperate to get it done. Once a team member is involved, the task never leaves his hands until its completion. Many members can be responsible for the task, and it's marked as done only when all the members finished their parts. This system also makes it easier to speak with your counterparts, improving communication.

No more arm wrestling, just straight cooperation!

## Technology Stack
Task Flow is built using cutting edge technologies. The front-end section is developed using JavaScript language and React. The back-end is Java based, making use of the Spring platform, exposing RESTFull services. The complete stack includes: React, reactstrap, Spring, Spring Boot, Hibernate.

### Important Note
This system is on early stages of development. It's not production ready yet.
